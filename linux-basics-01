The Birth of Linux â€“ A Brief History

Linux was created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student at the University of Helsinki. 
At the time, he was using MINIX, a small Unix-like operating system meant for educational purposes, but he found it too restrictive. 
Frustrated by its limitations, Linus decided to develop his own free and open-source operating system. On August 25, 1991, he announced his project in an online forum, stating that it was just a hobby and wouldn't be anything big. However, the project quickly gained traction, and developers from around the world started contributing. Originally, Linus wanted to name it "Freax", but his colleague Ari Lemmke uploaded it to a public server as "Linux" (a combination of Linus + Unix), and the name stuck.
Over the years, Linux evolved into one of the most stable, secure, and widely used operating systems across industries

Why Linux is Better Than Other Operating Systems? 

Linux stands out due to its open-source nature, allowing anyone to modify and improve it without restrictions.
Unlike Windows and macOS, which are paid and proprietary, Linux is free and offers users complete controL.
Security is another major advantageâ€”Linux is far less vulnerable to viruses and malware, making it the preferred choice for servers, cybersecurity, and cloud computing.
It is also lightweight and efficient, capable of running smoothly even on older hardware, whereas Windows tends to slow down over time.
Additionally, Linux provides unmatched customization, allowing users to tweak every aspect of their system, from appearance to functionality
It is the operating system of choice for developers, ethical hackers, AI researchers, and data scientists due to its powerful command-line tools and flexibility. 


Why Choose Linux Over Windows/macOS? 

Linux offers freedom, security, and performance without the constraints of proprietary software. 
It is free, highly customizable, and built for efficiency, making it an excellent choice for developers, businesses, and everyday users alike
Whether powering smartphones, supercomputers, or space missions, Linux continues to be the backbone of modern technology.
